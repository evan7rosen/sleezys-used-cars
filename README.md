# Quarter 2 Assessment - Stealership

## Overview

You were hired as a contractor by a used car dealership group called "Stealership". They have multiple locations around the world and really need a way to manage their inventory. Your job is to create a way for them to keep track of their past and present inventory.

## Other notes

- Required technologies: React/Redux
- Prop types in every component with props IS required.
- React Router is NOT required, but it might make organizing the data a little easier than stuffing it all into one page.
- Choose your design library at your own risk, i.e. Reactstrap, SemanticUI, MaterialUI, etc.
